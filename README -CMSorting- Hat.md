  # Sorting Hat

- Overview of the project
    This app will bring the Hogwarts "sorting" to life. The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a ficitional British boarding school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the first six books in J.K Rowlings Harry Potter series. 
   - This project demonstrates student's being sorted to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,  or Slytherin) of the Hogwarts School. If a student is expelled after 
    they have been sorted, the expelled student will display or move to Moldy Voldy's Army.
